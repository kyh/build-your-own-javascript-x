# Rebuilding frontend frameworks from scratch

> Featuring - Alpine, Vue, React, Redux, Angular, Styled Components

This repo will try to reproduce a minimal working version of each framework by building a [reactive counter example](https://webcomponents.dev/blog/all-the-ways-to-make-a-web-component/).

The core components of a reactive framework
- Keep track of some data
- When data changes, refresh the DOM
